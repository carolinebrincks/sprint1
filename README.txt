# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website – [carolinebrincks.me](https://carolinebrincks.me)

Hi there! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my background, skills, and projects in business analytics and information systems.

## 🧠 About the Project

This portfolio was built to highlight my academic and professional journey as a third-year student at the University of Iowa. It includes sections on who I am, the technologies I work with, and a growing collection of projects that reflect what I'm learning and building.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Azure Static Web Apps** – for hosting the site securely and efficiently
- **Namecheap** – for domain registration and DNS management
- **Visual Studio Code** – my go-to code editor for front-end work
- **GitHub Desktop** – for version control and repository syncing

## 🌍 Deployment Setup

Here’s how I linked everything together to deploy the site live:

1. **Developed Locally** using VS Code and GitHub Desktop.
2. **Hosted via Azure Static Web Apps** – easily set up through GitHub integration.
3. **Custom Domain Setup**:
   - Registered domain through Namecheap (https://www.namecheap.com/)
   - Added a **custom DNS** record pointing to my Azure Static Web App
   - Verified and connected the domain within the Azure portal

## 🚀 Live Site

## 📌 Purpose

This project serves as:
- A personal brand and online resume
- A hub for exploring my technical work and analytics projects
- A space to grow and evolve as I learn more

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
